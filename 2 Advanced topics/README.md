## **1. Numpy**
> Create an array, and check how many dimensions
- `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)`
- `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])`
- `arr.ndim`
- `arr.shape`  #detailed information of this array

> Array index
- `arr[1,1,1]`  # if there are three dimensions in  this array

> Slicing array
- `arr[0:2 , 1:4 , 1]`  # if there are three dimensions in  this array
